at hearings in the city council in last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that the layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they approached with the notice claims , the department of education , warning that against him filed ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .

at about 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but , personally , i become a little bit easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what he is part of a large " resistance " movement , a judge ruled that he is not mad , and said that there is no evidence , that he acted with accomplices .

" the consequences of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , would make such a strong contraction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of a ship or the building -- and will seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although foreign military financing in emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not the way , with whom we can live , and it 's not a solution , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta a letter or the recent warnings of senators will lead to strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from cuts or budget compromise that will see later .

" this paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " mr. panetta said in his introductory comments at the pentagon .

stories about fraud at exams in high school and college - standard affair .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
during one of the day , as studies show that , you can lie from 10 percent to 200 times .
another study showed that people unfamiliar солгали three times for the first 10 minutes with each other dating .
in contrast to the games room , akin to , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " identify lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , particularly in psychology and physiology .
not worth it from this difficult to conclude that the liars notice and it 's hard to expose .
i spent a few years , exploring the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which can easily learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or governance .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , lied to its partners that married people less than unmarried ( but the lie , which they say , most often наглая . )
watch позой laughter , voice characteristics , your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone might use the " qualification language , " when answering a difficult question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there 's no magical tools , to expose the lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changes in during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , specializing in chemical engineering , said .

which lacked the кандидатке from valle , in order to become the new miss columbia ? "
at this time мелина ramirez serna was to be satisfied with those winners that hit on the podium with silver ribbon proclaiming its new princess crown and colombia .

on the other hand , great britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - is only a few of those , who resolutely keeps their projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes , as an example , in reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
price , which the majority of the french refuse to pay more , because they do not oppose in principle of this kind of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs that cannot be moved in another industry .
what an engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated , to work for sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?

in france we have the security body , which operates edged and transparent control existing energy , such as фламанвиль centres .
in 50 years ago the nuclear industry has endured three serious security incident .
device in chernobyl reactor and непростительная human error has led to the tragedy .
nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле gorgeous gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to conquer leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears the influence of immigrants based on the view that they are able to replace local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking lowering wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the arrival of immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates great proportion of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all founded immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) on average , 150 000 euros .
mentioned teeth , which were used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
but democracy is very valuable acquisition ; simultaneously and the fragile .
some believed that democracy had finally triumphed over their enemies , is enough to arrange a vote and make it so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a prerequisite for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of repression " , as when something republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , that we are experiencing , " this economic crisis , but first and foremost , this is a political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , requiring a series of national referendums , organized as necessary and in хаотическом manner .
no , we dream not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but gradually loses its sovereignty , and the entire europe along with her each of its nations .
because only joint work of europeans will be able to reduce the severity of the debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this offer and jacques delors all socialists now require that the european economic government .
but to submit it without a stronger economic , political and democratic integration , вошедшей граздан in life , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish the republic , france needed to " create " republicans .
it can only be done through the creation of a more democratic europe on the political level , the present popular european sovereignty .

in august , the local branch of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis of al-shabaab operating in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to the continent .
