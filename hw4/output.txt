but this does not diminish automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the whole nation .

another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
was present , among other things , mitch mcconnell , the leader of the republicans in the senate and a well - known opponent of the health care law .
nothing new : two judges attend events society 's federalists have already been for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the sheer intimacy scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to the company with big financial interests , it was sufficient signal for the activists of ethics in government .
" judges wined and dined on the official campaign fundraising with lawyers , things which are now viewed in the court . "
scalia and thomas is unlikely to pay attention to critics who say they are very eager to mix business with the court фигурирующими society in matters of groups like the federalists .
moreover , conservatives argue that it is with regard to the judge elena kagan , ethical question arises , rather than scalia and thomas .
her critics , demanded that kagan refused a hearing on this case because she was too involved in the protection of the law , then , to be impartial now .

mexican president 's sister , apparently , lost the election in michoacan
president felipe calderon 's sister , seems to have not made its bid for the governor 's seat michoacan state elections during the fierce , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference of organised crime during the entire election process , and especially yesterday is alarming , not only for michoacan , but also for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon радиоинтервью in the next day , the sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades , is not yet lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , a candidate from the national action party , or ipa , led by her brother , refused to recognise the vallejo , the winner .
ауреолес also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
in michoacan has long dominated drug cartels , which specialize in the cannabis , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , however , no matter how badly looked in the michoacan election , victory will give a momentum boost for the party .
раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia may be protected to some extent , but she may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and has led to calls for the leading emerging economies to gather together to help the eurozone to find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help the wealthy europeans , when they are faced with their own deep economic problems .
" at some point they will learn that the greeks are retiring in the 50 years to come and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be perceived well , " he said .
mr. knag said that the eurozone crisis threatens to " significant direct consequences " throughout asia .
he said that the vulnerable emerging markets need to make " contingency plans " , to protect themselves from the downturn and the most significant оттоков capital from their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security , and will cause financial chain reaction from the pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and to civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке and john mccain , arizona , lindsey graham , south carolina .
" so , will make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects on кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or the building -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote the senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" although the foreign military financing in the emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , the military to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " panetta warned .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to the опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and the legal and political support will be disturbed . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings of senators will lead to strengthen calls for the release of the pentagon from cuts or fiscal compromise , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops with shell , but without the putter .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects may face obstacles , including those that have already been undergoing tests , and only some of the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly attempted to hide that a retired football coach raping boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud charges on the exams in school and college - this is business as usual .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
should not be from this it is difficult to draw the conclusion that the liars notice and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that - modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or control .
we know from studies that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , and that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or to change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use the disengagement in the speech : " i did n't have a sexual relationship with this woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone could use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know it . "
there is no magic money , to expose the lie , but to master the skill of deception detection can be .

модоло recalls that already has a work made outside the кальсеролы , which " should not miss ailianduo " , although he 's grateful for the possibility that city hall offers his profession , to join in this project " since the beginning . "
байона hints that answer the question , which specifies the name of this part of the complex , as in the contest rules lacks a common type of кольсеролы : " it was announced 16 intersecting contests , " he says , " within the meaning of the sea - mountain , but there are no longitudinal , reading , to see and understand the region as a whole . "
on the other hand , a project for some gate may overlap on the program , and identifying with the project architect for a neighboring gate .

he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changing during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , specializing in chemical engineering , said .
among the most is the upper layers of bitumen , made up of small stones , опущенных in bitumen and then спрессованных .
a movement of vehicles and latch efforts , it helps forces to be distributed on the road to cover very well .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this is a healthy trend that the electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france must build their own opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that 's why germany remains one of its decision to abandon its nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - so that 's just a few of those , who resolutely keeps his projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .

then administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in his program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will help solve our immigration problem " .
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor force , and the most qualified , in the dynamic sectors , where training is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it 's without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the organization of labor , for example , in germany , an immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to arrange a vote , and make him so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as the need and хаотическом alright .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but gradually loses its sovereignty , and the entire europe along with her each of its nations .
because only a collaborative effort of the europeans will be able to reduce the severity of debt of each , free markets and prepare for the future , investing in him .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to represent her without a stronger economic integration , political and democratic , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .

" this is a step forward , but there is no doubt , we need to wait for more reliable evidence , before talk about the operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" for many years already , we know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that it is becoming more and more intense , " says кунле амуво , a nigeria researcher .
the international community , led by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to pay attention to the boko haram , which creates problems .
she is focused mainly on the church , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august , the local branch of the united nations , will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

mitt romney , who has the best chance for the nomination from " good old party " , has threatened to sue the chinese complaint to the wto and accuse them of " manipulating its currency is a sensitive topic for america , irritated migration as much as their industries in asia .
john huntsman , former obama ambassador to china and the only candidate , the complicated foreign policy , failed to overcome the position which indulging your emotions .
but huntsman , who rests at the bottom of the ratings , have remained неуслышанным .
romney has also promised the military strikes against iran if sanctions will not be able to halt its nuclear program .

entrepreneur distance kane , second in the ranking candidates demonstrated the daunting ignorance of the cases .
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and strives for military strikes on iran , said that he was ready to use the american army against the drug cartels in mexico .

gas pipeline was designed to work in 50 years ago without the need for the slightest maintenance and repairs .
