six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , the schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .
representatives of the district council 37 , said that they have with the notice claims , department of education , warning that filed a lawsuit against him ; on wednesday will be held a press conference to announce the formal filing suit in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokesperson for the city 's legal department , said that the city have n't seen the lawsuit and therefore cannot comment on its specific provisions .

but in the same day , when bill failed in the house of representatives , the chamber also has not supported a proposal which would cut funding for american operations in libya .
resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism .

this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives bob гудлатом ( a republican , virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else , which will be on the plenary vote in congress this session .
amendment гудлата - only one of 68 , constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues , which were made in this convening .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the house of representatives and much else about the " control over federal spending . "

in addition to the budget , some congressmen want to limit the number of deadlines of members of congress , jose serrano ( democrat and member of the house of representatives , new york ) wants to cancel the restriction of the two term for president .
amendment banning same - sex marriages already offer for many years , and as another , banning flag burning .
as neither aspired to members of congress to propose amendments , they are not faster , than in years past .
this rate pales in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s , when members of congress , according to the library of the senate , regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years .
the latest amendment , which was adopted , the 27 - i - was approved by parliament in 1992 , but in congress she actually was in 1789 .

on monday , breivik , suspected of committing mass murder in norway in july , which has taken the lives of 77 people , appeared at his first open the hearing .
after the summer of tragedy researchers wanted to learn more about these people .
supply of personal data on facebook is so great , " says bartlett , that the researchers could easily use the site 's advertising tool , to highlight the demographic group with scientific precision - that marketers and doing for several years already .
using the facebook bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants 14 extremely right - wing parties in 11 european countries - even without leaving the office .
some not - so results are striking : online - male supporters of right - wing groups -- often young people , unhappy with immigration .
demos work - just one example of how facebook is becoming a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists .
with more than 800 million active users , add on average , three records in the day , " super - hot information , " facebook causes research boom , increasing the number of scientific articles with the name of the site in the headline 800 % over the past five years .
" before , if you want to interview people from the british national party , would have been very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook excludes all this - you to contact him directly . "
recent research by dr. megan moreno from the university of wisconsin , madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook , were significantly more vulnerable to alcoholism than students who were silent on this occasion .
" you ca n't solve the problem , not her , " said washington post димитри выявив христакис moreno , the co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development , and in the seattle children 's research institute .
facebook also constantly pulls all sorts of data about its users .
but facebook users know that the site is watching them , like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play in скраббл , with another , in thousands of miles from you , the site can handle your personal data .
while researchers have a strictly certain norms of conduct offline - research data , online publicity .

about 30 survivors and victims ' relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but personally , i became a little easier , after i saw and heard the suspect . "
despite breivik 's a strange idea about what he is part of a large " resistance " movement , the judge ruled that he 's not a mad , and said that there is no proof that he acted with accomplices .
but this does not diminish automatically grief and confusion , which now feels the whole nation .

scalia and thomas lunch with opponents of the healthcare act , until the court is considering the case
this incident took place in the last thursday , when all nine justices met to discuss filed petitions for review .
judges have agreed to consider the process ; in fact , behalterbau debate lasting in 5 1/2 hours are expected in march 2012 , but the outcome will likely become a hindrance in the presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time , when a court decision .
firm clement , bancroft pllc , was one of the nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor annual lunch society , long - existing groups , federalists , constantly conservative legal principles .
another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant pflizer inc , which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of litigation .
present , among others , in the senate republican leader mitch mcconnell , and well - known opponent of the healthcare law .
nothing new : two judges attend the event of society federalists already for many years .
in fact , the judges are free from the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges .
nevertheless , the apparent closeness scalia and thomas to two legal firms in this case , as well as to companies with big financial interests , was sufficient signal for activists of ethics in government .

раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said that the two most emerging big economies must do " everything that can " to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc with the help of either the international monetary fund , or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia may be protected to some extent , but she may not be invulnerable . "
the european monetary union was severely undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the global economy into recession again , and led to calls for the leading emerging economies gather together to help the eurozone find a solution . "
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can , " to help the eurozone , such as its own economy is now declining exports and decline in foreign capital inflows .
" we have a grandiose objectives , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields battlefield in afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly .
" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes would undermine confidence in those who support our army , and will bring serious damage combat readiness . "
" although foreign military financing in emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced , that will lead to опозданиям staffer with payments military suppliers , and legal and political support will be broken . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be the fastest decline of the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live in , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings from senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release of the pentagon from reductions , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what may be followed by further -- troops with shell , but without the putter .
" it 's a paper tiger , the army , with barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said , in their introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may encounter obstacles , including those which passed the tests , and some only in the early stages of planning .
halt to further develop and test f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say , that is a vital next step , in order to improve and to counter potential threats , china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows just how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .

stories about the fraud on exams in school and college - standard thing .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the room of the game , like , say , charades , where the need to exclaim " caught ! " , identifying lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the last six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on the psychology and physiology .
not worth it from doing this conclusion , that liars hard notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , by examining the scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that - modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or control .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that the men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lies , which they say , often наглая ) .
watch asphyxia , laughter , voice characteristics of your object .
rats can fix the upper part of his body , when trying to remember its history , they can put their feet toward the door , bend towards the exit , or to change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complex issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when responding to a complex question : " well ... to tell the truth ... as far as i know ... how i know . "
there is no magical means deception detection , to detect the lies , but to master the skill you can .

during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
here is why germany remains alone in her decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , the netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - here is only a few of those who strongly continues their projects .
although germany 's model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого wind ; due to what carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that the majority of the french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , she attracts a contemporaries specialized on international trade in small and medium - sized enterprises and creates a lot of jobs , which may not be moved to another industry .
any engineer - electrician will order epr , calculated to work , sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
areva solutions with a low carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , testifies to the взаимодополнимости .
security in france we have the body , which carries edged and transparent control existing energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident , as learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all the specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , halt its construction in фламанвиле will be a great gift for menacing rivals areva and edf , ​​путь them toward the conquest of leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then was administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) said that " do n't need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see immigration as a burden for the french economy and for the french society .
francois hollande , in their program was confined to platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
fears for the influence of immigrants are based on the view , that they are able to replace local workers , especially for low - skilled , provoking decrease in salaries .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a lack of анестезиологов , complementarity , existing between local that the arrival of the immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect the wages of local workers .
and it 's without taking into account the fact that the diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo - were all immigrants are based ) .
according to the labor organization , in germany , for example , the immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring to the state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) , on average , 150 000 euros .
referred teeth , which used to scaring immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to arrange a vote , and make him so direct , as far as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a sine qua non condition for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of suppression " , as republican once - philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing , is an economic crisis , but in the first of all this political crisis and the crisis of democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding a series of national referenda , organized as the need and хаотическом alright .
there is no , we are dreaming not on the edge the guillotine , but on the implementation of - the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
many worry about the transfer of sovereignty to europe , but gradually loses its sovereignty , and the entire europe along with her each of its nations .
because only joint work europeans can reduce the severity of debt each , extricating itself from the markets , and prepare for the future , investing in it .
after a lengthy discussion of this proposal now require all socialists and jacques delors european economic government .
but to represent her without a stronger economic integration , political and democratic , maturing in life граздан , is another madness and a new impasse .
to establish a republic in france , it was necessary to " create a " of republicans .
this can only be done by creating a more democratic europe on the political level , the present popular european sovereignty .

analysis of the incidents calls pointed out several interlocutors , 58/89 in mali , niger and nigeria .

" for many years already know that the sect идейную and receives financial support from the outside and that she is becoming more and more active , " says кунле амуво , nigeria researcher .
the international community headed by washington now puts pressure on абуджу , to attention on boko haram , which creates problems .
she focused mostly on the churches , bars and authorities .
in the past christmas , she took on responsibility for the diluted share , as a result of which 80 people were killed in джосе , and then another for one in abuja .
in august , local representation of the united nations will be their first international goal .
today , when the aqmi has spiked in mali and niger , and the somalis from al-shabaab operate in kenya , boko haram represents a new threat to continent .

but huntsman , who rests at the bottom of the ratings , have remained неуслышанным .
romney also promised military strikes on iran , if the sanctions will not be able to stop its nuclear program .
" if obama will be re - elected , they will have a bomb . "
entrepreneur distance kane , ranking second in the candidates , demonstrated the daunting ignorance affairs .
texas governor rick perry , who supports israel , and seeks military strikes on iran , says that he was ready to use the american army against drug cartels in mexico .
it 's all very far from the republican candidate john mccain 's 2008 , тяжеловеса foreign policy .

nord stream , new gates for the entry of russian gas to europe .
it is calculated on the supply of gas equivalent of 30 million households .
