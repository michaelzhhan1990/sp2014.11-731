six hundred and seventy - two school assistant coordinator , working with parents and other employees who were among the most low - wage workers in the city , have lost their place on october 7 , as a result of that union leaders called the political reaction to their refusal to give access to medical city funds , managed workers ' groups , to close a hole in the budget last spring .
at a hearing in the city council last month , schools chancellor dennis m. уолкотт said that layoffs were part of the budget , which they signed in june .

resolution " admires the people of libya 's foreign affairs committee for his incredible bravery and formidable resistance in the quest for freedom " and thanked the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners , who participated in military operations to protect the libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism . "
whether the new measures will receive full support of the council on foreign affairs or расколют legislators , as the june bill ?
представитель люгера said on monday that he has not yet seen the latest bill .
this measure , proposed a member of the u.s. house of representatives , republican bob гудлатом ( virginia ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or about anything else that will be on the plenary vote of congress this session .

president felipe calderon 's sister , it seems , made its bid for the governor of michoacan state elections during the fierce , and she said on monday that the traffickers have helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" interference by organized crime during the entire election process and particularly alarming , not only for michoacan , but yesterday and for the whole country , " said luisa maria calderon радиоинтервью in the next day , sunday after the vote .
pri ruled mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , national action party candidate , or ipa , headed by her brother , refused to acknowledge вальехо winner .
ауреолес also refused to accept the preliminary results .
long dominated drug cartels in michoacan , specialize in cannabis , heroin and метамфетаминах .
for the pri , but no matter how badly looked in the michoacan elections , victory would give party momentum behind .
раджат naga , managing director of the adb 's office in manila , said the two most big emerging economies must " do everything that can " to accelerate the recovery in the currency bloc with the international monetary fund or direct bilateral agreements .
" asia may be protected to some extent , but she may not be invulnerable . "
european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .
unfolding in europe 's debt crisis has spawned fears that he can lead the world economy into recession again , and led to calls for leading economies gather together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's trade minister , said that " india will do everything that can " to help the eurozone , as its own economy is now declining exports and reducing foreign capital inflows .
" we have ambitious goals , and we must maintain a high level of growth . "
others argue that there is no sense for emerging economies like india to help wealthy europeans , when they face their own deep economic problems .
" at some point , they know that greeks are retiring in 50 years and go on holidays to the sea , and it will not be perceived well , " he said .

defense secretary leon panetta tempers in congress on monday , warning that expected automatic budget cuts will undermine national security and bring the financial chain reaction from pentagon corridors to the fields of battle in afghanistan on the line and civic assembly .
" the consequences of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham of south carolina .
" so , make such a strong reduction , the majority of our construction projects кораблестроению and unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although the foreign military financing in emergency military operations not directly affected секвестром , to be severely affected by a serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced that lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the ministry of defense will become the fastest decline in the united states as the world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to budget compromise or inflame calls for release from the pentagon cuts , we 'll see later .
at a press conference last week , defense minister painted a gloomy picture of what might follow next -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .
" this paper tiger , the army to barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his introductory remarks in the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects may encounter obstacles , including those who passed the tests , and only some in the early stages of planning .
halting further development and testing the f 35 can save $ 80 billion over 10 years , but his supporters say is a vital next step to improve and to counter potential threats from china and other opponents .
a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged лжесвидетельствовании schlensker , because they allegedly hid that retired football coach raped young boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was indicted in financial fraud during the campaign , involving укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on exams in school and college - standard thing .
mentors , who must teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
in one day , studies show that you can lie from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
in contrast to the games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " to detect lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth of hard to conclude that liars do notice and it is difficult to expose .
i spent a few years , examining scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts than introverts lied more frequently , that men are more lie about yourself , whereas women -- about the other , usually to protect someone 's feelings that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie , that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people can also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use the " qualification " language , when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

he explained that on saturday will be held антропометрические measurement of all participants ( height , weight and waist girth ) , measuring blood pressure , glucose and fats , cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity ) .
in medical research , conducted in the period from 1999 to 2006 , says that there was just 6 years growth : in case boys 77 percent were obese , 47 % in the case of girls ; when it comes to weight , there is also experienced substantial growth , " said specialist mssi .

рафаель эррера chemical faculty unam , researcher , developed a polymer - bitumen , modified to produce a mixture of the best quality , sustainable to the impacts of environmental and temperature .
in his lecture in technological view of the pits , as part of the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to the bitumen production , but with the best opposition , both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that the resistance street asphalt is not constant , and changing during the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , specializing in chemical engineering , said .
among the upper layers of bitumen that is made up of little stones опущенных bitumen , and then спрессованных .
when vehicles and прикладывании efforts , it helps forces of very well be on the road to cover .
on асфальтовом cover , he added , placed last layer , called a layer of wear and tear , which is made of sand and small stone , in fact immersed in the asphalt .
as part of the pavement , which will receive and distribute data layer wear also requires the proper thickness , and efforts should take into consideration the material , from which he is .
when earth crude , water penetrates the surface and it 's hard for her to go from there , it causes размягчение all layers of cover , and therefore education yam .
also a member of the national transportation system , researchers explained that stress is another important factor in the formation of holes , and therefore the thickness of each layer coating should always be associated with transport load and need to ensure this requirement , to prevent the frequent appearance of yam .
and not enough кандидатке from valle to become a new miss colombia ?
at this time мелина ramirez serna was to be satisfied with those winners that hit on the podium with silver ribbon proclaiming its new princess crown and colombia .
the first factor , who played role in addressing the jury to award her the title first princess , was that she failed to conclusively answer the question " what you and why ? , the book describes martin мурилье гомесом from literary society , let 's honor .
" i read a lot , i believe in literature , i think that this form окультуривания highlighted , and definitely believe that the book , my childhood -- " the little prince " is a fairly deep book .
response , which did n't like the jury because of the term " , " and , secondly , due to the fact that not explained exactly how each процитированных books it describes .

"
though both looked confident , it was obvious that she lacks the power and energy , who showed representatives магдалены and атлантико .

that 's why member international jury selection in two days before lucy doty said that they are looking for a woman , приверженную social needs of their country .
there are also the assumption that valle грешила spokeswoman defects on the buttocks and фиброзом , which was visible on her stomach , but it is debatable , as the jury specifically noted her as кандидатку with natural beauty , " given its more than a healthy body , good nutrition and physical work .
the magazine , a journalist _guido ойос кромос believes that the mistake females valle de cauca was that she has undergone surgery .
her body was never her advantage , and here she was punished for it .
so it or not , the fact that we have today мелины begins year rule , not as queen , but as the princess , position , which allows her to represent colombia directly on one of the international competition , the organizers of the national contest .

tougher law after 2002 has led to a systematic securityexception hospital lasting more than 45 days .

for the extension or termination of medical care , the situation is less than , say the authors report .

some experts in the field of legislation , associated with the health care experts , have already expressed concerns about the conclusion of a report of the royal society of canada .

insee , despite this , revised reduction figures in the second quarter , with 0.1 % fall in gross domestic product ( gdp ) instead of stagnation .
germany , in turn , documented the growth of 0.5 % for the same period .
if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or influenced by emotion , so it 's energy policy .
this healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france must build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete fossil resources to continue electricity production is growing deficit , not forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate imbalances - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
that is why germany remains one of their decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil is just a few of those who resolutely keeps his projects .
although the german model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 percent of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind , carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and 50 % higher than average in europe .
as the price of energy is a key factor in a globalized economy competitiveness and service of industrial equipment in the national territory , the french company benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that most french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .
heavily export - oriented , it attracts a плеяду specialized on international trade in small and medium enterprises and create many jobs that cannot be moved into another industry .
any engineer and electrician would order epr , calculated to sixty years , if the planned closure of its manufacturer ?
areva decisions with low - carbon development , nuclear and renewable energy sources , indicating взаимодополнимости .
in france we have security agency , which monitors existing edged and transparent energy centres , such as фламанвиль .
for 50 years , the nuclear industry has survived three serious incident .
in the chernobyl reactor device and unforgivable human error led to tragedy .
nuclear industry извлечет lessons from this accident as the learned from the previous two .
as he viewed all specialists in the field of energy , to build a reactor , will halt its construction in фламанвиле gorgeous gift competitors areva and edf , menacing them ​​путь to conquer leadership in the imminent development of nuclear energy .
then administrative harassment of foreign students , which was in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from france on may 23 ) , said that " do not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard to work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов , complementarity between local that the arrival of immigrants and immigrants , leads to positively affect wages local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all based immigrants ) .
according to labor organization , for example , in a german immigrant , arrived at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring the budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
these teeth , which used to scare immigrants , gave exactly the opposite effect .
democracy is fragile and valuable acquisition ; but at the same time .
some thought that democracy has triumphed over their enemies , enough to vote and make it so direct as possible .
universal vote , though , and is a prerequisite for democracy , it is not sufficient condition and may even become a " tool of repression " , as when something republican philosopher etienne вашро said .
the european crisis , which we are experiencing is an economic crisis , but first , it is a political crisis and democracy .
we do n't win anything , demanding series of national referendums , organized as needed and хаотическом order .
no , we dream not лезвии guillotine , but on the implementation of the joint , clear and uninterrupted - choice and democracy , this time on pan - european level .
the entire europe submits to the dictates of markets and rating agencies , suffers from its weakness and lack of solidarity .
