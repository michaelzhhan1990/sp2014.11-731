european monetary union was badly undermined by the european debt crisis in recent months .

" the consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the state department , " panetta said in a letter to senators республиканцу республиканке john mccain , arizona and lindsey graham , south carolina .
" such a strong reduction , so , make most of our projects кораблестроению repressions and construction unfulfilled -- you ca n't buy a three - quarters of the ship or buildings -- and do serious damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote senators .
" these changes undermine trust , who supports our army and will seriously damage боеготовности . "
" although foreign military financing in emergency operations does not directly affected секвестром , military achievements be severely affected by serious breakdown in the main budgets , " warned panetta .
" staff will be reduced that lead to опозданиям staffer with military suppliers , and legal and political support will be disrupted . "
" the consequence of sequestration in the department of defense will be rapid decline in the united states as world 's leading military powers . "
" this is not an option , with which we live , and this is not an option , which we need to impose ourselves . "
whether panetta letter or recent warnings senators will lead to pentagon budget compromise or inflame calls for release from cutbacks , see later .
at a press conference last week , defence minister painted a gloomy picture of what might follow further -- troops with shell , but without the kernel .

a cursory glance at recent headlines , shows how serious and повсеместны deception and lies in everyday life .
administration at the university of pennsylvania was charged in лжесвидетельствовании , because they allegedly hid the schlensker retired football coach raped boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards was charged in the financial machinations during the campaign , associated with укрывательством extramarital affairs .
stories about the fraud on exams in school and college - standard thing .
mentors who should teach the opposite , send a message that the lies and fraud are acceptable .
studies have shown that within a single day , you can lie from 10 up to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers солгали three times for the first 10 minutes to get acquainted with each other .
unlike games room , like , say , charades , where you exclaim , " caught ! " identification of lies is a serious direction knowledge , based on scientific data , collected over the past six decades in the prestigious universities , comprehensive research projects , especially on psychology and physiology .
not worth from doing this conclusion that liars difficult note and it is hard to expose .
i spent a few years , examining scientific discoveries in the vast and ever - growing segment of knowledge about lie detection , and it is clear that modern skill , which is easy to learn and that helps in meaningful in our complex world -- especially if your professional duties include recruiting , interviewing , negotiating or management .
we know from research that extroverts lied more frequently than introverts , that men lie about yourself , whereas women -- more about the other , usually in order to protect someone 's feelings , that married people lied to its partners , less than unmarried ( but the lie that they say , often наглая ) .
watch позой , laughter , voice your subject characteristics .
rats can fix the upper part of his body when trying to remember their history , they can put their feet towards the door , bend towards the exit , or change its position in a certain way to demonstrate " relief after the interview " -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and a change in posture , when all the complicated issues behind us .
привирающие people may also use disengagement in the speech : " i have n't had sexual relations with that woman miss lewinsky " or repeat a complicated question entirely . ...
someone can use " qualification " language , when responding to a complex question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "
there is no magical means to detect lies , but to master the skill can detect deception .

in his lecture in technological view of the pits , under the international year of chemistry , reported that laboratory , for which he is responsible for developing polymer - modified bitumen mixed with characteristics close to bitumen production , but with the best resistance both high and at low temperatures .
he explained that the bitumen , the toughest part of the oil is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules , some high - molecular weight , called асфальтенами and other low - molecular weight called мальтенами , which together give the road to cover his tmina вязкоупругое behaviour .
this means that resistance street asphalt is not permanent , and varies throughout the day , depending on the natural conditions and temperature , said specializing in chemical engineering .

if there is a theme , a decision on which cannot be taken after a short discussion or under the influence of emotions , so this is an energy policy .
this healthy trend that electoral meeting place , and become an occasion for reflection about the share of their nuclear energy .
france must build their opinion on objective facts and data on the rational .
during the same period will be necessary to complete a growing scarcity of fossil resources , to continue electricity production , not forgetting the constantly critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to fight climate imbalance - theme , which disappeared from the environmental debate .
here is why germany remains alone in her decision to abandon nuclear energy .
on the other hand , britain , finland , poland , czech republic , netherlands , sweden , south africa , china , india , brazil - is only a few of those who strongly continues their projects .
although germany 's model , based on renewable energy , sometimes cited as an example , the reality belies this argument .
european champion construction of turbines , from which she receives 30 % of its electricity , as well as the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to прерывистого due ; the wind which carbon emissions and electricity prices by 65 per cent , respectively , and on average 50 % higher than in europe .
as in a globalized economy , the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the keystone of the service of industrial equipment on the national territory , the french companies are benefiting from cheap electricity in europe .
the price that most french refuse to pay more because they do not oppose in principle , this type of energy .

then were administrative harassment of foreign students , which in the news , when the minister of interior ( " либерасьон " from may 23 ) stated that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
both sides see the burden for the french economy and immigration for french society .
in his program francois hollande ограничился platitudes , saying that " joint work will solve our immigration problem . "
as ian goldin and jeffrey cameron reminds us economists in a recent book , обобщившей recent data on immigration ( special : how migration shaped our world and people will determine our future , may 2011 , publisher at princeton university , with 352 . ) , there is a broad consensus among experts about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , employment and wages in countries that accept immigrants .
influenced by fears of immigrants based on the view that they can replace the local workers , especially low - skilled , provoking wage declines .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor , and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors , where tuition is not connected with offers of work .
just as the surgeon would be hard work in the country , where there is a shortage of анестезиологов complementarity , existing between local and immigrants , leads that the arrival of the immigrants positively affects the wages of local workers .
and this without taking into account the fact that diversity , вносимое immigrants , contributes to new ideas and economic growth ( among american nobel laureates large share of naturalised immigrants , and google , intel , paypal and yahoo were all immigrants are based ) .
labor organization estimates that in germany , for example , the immigrant , arriving at the age of 30 years , for his life will bring state budget net profit ( revenue minus expenses ) in an average of 150,000 euros .
