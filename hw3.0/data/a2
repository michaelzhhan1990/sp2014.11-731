all this raises the question of whether china will replace for america as they define global hegemonic power and applied rules of the global economy . 
this is unsustainable , and eventually precipitate confrontation of proportions with america ( and europe ) . 
the more centralized political power is more , not hinder the central development of markets . 
instead , political integration could have an impact on the opposite development of markets . 
but now it seems that america has also into trouble again and weaken the pact wants . 
for their part , and china , will develop their own capacity and financial markets of high - quality financial assets generate internally . 
clearly , the second option is preferable . 
the asian financial crisis and devaluation in early 1999 brazilian that caused the argentine was decidedly overvalued . 
a cumulative had deficit - account and a burden - debt ratios of that literally were greek . 
it was thanks to what can be seen , has seen the parameters historical , as an exceptional period of political stability .
